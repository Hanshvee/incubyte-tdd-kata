## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project strictly follows the TDD methodology:

> **Red ➜ Green ➜ Refactor ➜ Integrate**

- **Red**: Write failing tests before code.
- **Green**: Write just enough code to pass.
- **Refactor**: Clean up without breaking tests.
- **Integrate**: Commit changes with test validation.

### 🔺 TDD Pyramid

> **Developer Focus:**  
> Developers should prioritize:
>
> - ✅ Unit Tests (Fast, isolated tests for core logic using JUnit + Mockito)
> - ✅ Integration Tests (Spring Boot Tests for API and database interactions)

## ❌ Common Myth: "TDD Slows Development"

### ✅ The Reality: TDD accelerates development in the long run by:

- Catching bugs early.
- Promoting modular, maintainable code.
- Speeding up refactoring and onboarding.
- Reducing time spent on manual QA.
- Making integration seamless and confident.
